 Transport for London:
During this mini-project, I have worked with the API from [Transport of London](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). The main goal of this project is to practice different HTTP requests and extracting values from complex lists and nested dictionaries.

IMDB:
In this part of the project, I have looked at information about favorite movies and actors.
